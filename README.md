# BYU-Idaho Resume Resource Repository (RRR)

I have built this repository to be used as a resource for students looking to enhance their resume. The first step in creating a great resume is realizing that it can be the stepping stone to landing a job after undergrad. Crafting the __perfect__ resume is a near impossible task, but taking the time and the effort to create a truly informative summary of your skills and professional life can go a long way in the search for an internship or job. 

My motivation for creating this pool of resources for students is that at one point I was a student struggling to find a way to make myself marketable to employers. Through the process of networking and getting my resume torn to shreds by every professional I came in contact with, I was able to find my own unique way of marketing myself as a valuable job candidate. While your resume refinement should come with some struggle, I hope to make starting this process easier for younger students just starting college. 

_Here's a little break down of what's currently in this repo:_

__Expose_Resume.pptx__ 

  * This a presentation I have given to different socities and student groups across campus. This is a running project that I will be continously adding to, feel free to browse the slides.

__resumes_2011.pdf__ 

  * This is the initial resume packet that was given to me by Professor Gifford. After getting my resume critiqued by him, my eyes were opened to just how lacking my resume was. These resumes are a great foundation and example to start modeling after your own resume. 

__resumes_2017.pdf__ 

  * This file is my attempt at creating a more updated resume packet of students who have recently graduated and gone on to work at relatively prestigious firms. Once again, I hope this can be a resource to students as they see how resume styles might change over time.
